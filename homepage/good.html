              <p class="p-style">
                I am currently a Computing Science student at the University of
                Alberta in my last semester of my degree. I enjoy full stack
                development to help produce cohesive user experiences and
                learning more in the web tech space. Outside of school, I enjoy
                spending time with friends trying new foods and seeing new
                sights, mashing buttons in Nintendo games, and spending
                countless hours watching Youtube videos

            <h2>Professional History</h2>
            <h3>Square</h3>
            <h4>Software Engineer Intern - Summer 2020 - Remote</h4>
            <p class="p-style">
              I worked on Square's flagship Dashboard front end application that
              all business channels use like Point of Sale (POS), Capital,
              Restaurants. During my time I used Ember.js to build out
              variations of the site's navigation to test out to the public as 4
              A/B tests. This was to help assess menu customization and
              usability issues and recommend future UI changes. Also brought
              5000+ sellers to convert to Dashboard by deploying new POS
              initiatives on the homepage. Outside of regular work, also built a
              webpage with a team of interns during a hackathon week to help
              bring awareness to mobile sellers on one platform using Vue.

            <h3>Diversity of Experiences</h3>
            <p class="p-style">
              During my degree, not only did I study as a student but also
              participated in a variety of experiences to enhance my learning.
              Academic wise, I did Undergraduate Research focusing on comparing
              metrics between software libraries to help users select libraries
              for their work. In addition, worked on Review Board, a open source
              platform dedicated to help make code review easier. Outside of
              school, I like honing my skills at Hhckathons and volunteering for
              Ada's Team, a Diversity and Inclusion tech group by organizing
              events behind the scenes along with helping students attend
              conferences.
